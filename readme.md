This project was created to help decode the EQ spell file and provide detailed information on spell, discipline and AA effects beyond what is shown in the game.

e.g. what the game shows for "Guardian of the Forest":

```
This ability transforms you into an exceptionally bloodthirsty wolf that attacks
with lightning speed, for a brief time. Additional ranks increase your offensive
capabilities and cause the transition into the wolf to heal many of your wounds.
```

Compare this with the parser description for the same spell:

```

#Web Version#

The easiest way to use the parser is via the web version here:

http://www.raidloot.com/Spells.aspx


#Downloadable Version#

If you want to parse historical, test or beta server spell data you will need to download the parser and run it on your own machine.

https://bitbucket.org/raidloot/eqspellparser/downloads/parser.zip

The download file contains winparser.exe which can open up spell files to be parsed on your own computer.

On Windows 8 or newer, the first time you run the parser will you get a "Windows protected your PC" alert. This is called SmartScreen and protects your PC from running programs from unrecognized publishers - which is what I am. If you want to run the parser you will need to click the "More Info" link on the popup and then "Run anyway".

You will also need to have Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 installed to run the parser. This is a windows add-on that you may be missing if you have an older version of windows. If you run the parser and it doesn't work for you, download the required windows update from here:

#How To Help#

You can help improve this parser even if you're not a programmer. If you discover spell descriptions that you think are incorrect or incomplete please send me an email at raidloot@gmail.com with an explanation or a link to more information.
